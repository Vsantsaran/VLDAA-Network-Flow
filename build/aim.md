### Aim of the Experiment

To implement and visualize the Ford–Fulkerson Algorithm for computing maximum flow in a network while ensuring capacity and conservation constraints are met. The experiment focuses on analyzing algorithmic efficiency through execution time and augmenting path counts across varying network scales. Additionally, it demonstrates the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem by identifying the bottleneck edges that limit total network throughput.
