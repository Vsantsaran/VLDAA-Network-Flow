    {
      "question": "In a flow network, what does the 'Capacity Constraint' imply for any edge (u, v)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The flow must be equal to the capacity",
        "b": "The flow must be greater than or equal to the capacity",
        "c": "The flow cannot exceed the capacity of the edge",
        "d": "The flow must be a prime number"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Flow can be any value from 0 up to the capacity.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Flow is limited by the physical capacity, not forced to exceed it.",
        "c": "Correct! Flow f(u,v) must always satisfy 0 ≤ f(u,v) ≤ c(u,v).",
        "d": "Incorrect. Flow is typically represented by real numbers or integers."

    {
      "question": "What is the 'Flow Conservation' rule for an intermediate node?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Total incoming flow must equal total outgoing flow",
        "b": "Incoming flow must be greater than outgoing flow",
        "c": "All nodes must have at least one unit of flow",
        "d": "Nodes store flow like a reservoir"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Except for the source and sink, flow cannot 'leak' or 'accumulate' at a node.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would imply the node is consuming flow.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Nodes can have zero flow passing through them.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Nodes in this model do not store flow; they only redirect it."

      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "If the total flow leaving the source is 15 units, what must be the total flow entering the sink?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It depends on the number of edges",
        "b": "Exactly 15 units",
        "c": "Less than 15 units due to friction",
        "d": "At least 30 units"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The network structure doesn't change the conservation of total flow.",
        "b": "Correct! Due to conservation, whatever leaves the source must eventually arrive at the sink.",
        "c": "Incorrect. We assume an ideal network without 'leakage' or losses.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Flow cannot be created within the intermediate nodes."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes a 'Source' node in a flow network?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A node where all edges are incoming",
        "b": "A node with no incoming edges (net producer of flow)",
        "c": "A node that cannot be connected to the sink",
        "d": "The node with the highest index"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That describes a sink node.",
        "b": "Correct! A source is where flow originates in the network.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The source must have a path to the sink for flow to exist.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Node indexing is arbitrary."

      "question": "In a directed graph used for flow networks, an edge (u, v) means:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Flow can travel from u to v and v to u",
        "b": "Flow can only travel from u to v",
        "c": "u and v are the same node",
        "d": "The edge has no capacity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That would be an undirected edge.",
        "b": "Correct! Directionality is key to defining the path of the flow.",
        "c": "Incorrect. (u, v) represents a connection between two distinct nodes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Every edge in a flow network must have a defined capacity."

      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if a node has more flow entering than leaving?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It violates flow conservation (unless it is the sink)",
        "b": "The extra flow is deleted",
        "c": "The algorithm runs faster",
        "d": "The node changes color"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Conservation requires balance at all nodes except source and sink.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Flow cannot be deleted in a standard model.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Violating constraints leads to incorrect results.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is a logical error, not a visual feature."

      "question": "Can an edge have a negative capacity?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Yes, for reverse flow",
        "b": "No, capacity must be non-negative",
        "c": "Only if the graph is complex",
        "d": "Only in the residual graph"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Reverse flow is handled via the residual graph, not negative capacity.",
        "b": "Correct! Capacity represents a physical limit, which cannot be less than zero.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Complexity does not change the non-negativity rule.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Residual capacities are also non-negative (c - f)."

      "question": "If an edge has a capacity of 10 and a current flow of 4, how much more flow can it handle?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "10 units",
        "b": "4 units",
        "c": "6 units",
        "d": "14 units"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 4 units are already in use.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 4 is the current flow, not the remaining space.",
        "c": "Correct! 10 (capacity) - 4 (current flow) = 6 units of remaining capacity.",
        "d": "Incorrect. You cannot exceed the original capacity."

        "a": "Incorrect. Sorting deals with ordering data.",

        "b": "False (only one of each is allowed)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Multiple sources/sinks can be handled by adding a 'super-source' and 'super-sink'.",
